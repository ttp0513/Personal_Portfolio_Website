I’m a **Software & Web Developer** who approaches every project with a **system design mindset**. I believes that great products are built by **breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable components** and designing systems that evolve gracefully over time.

Since starting my web development journey in **August 2025**, I’ve been focused on building a strong foundation in **frontend development**, while learning how to plan, structure, and deliver projects that reflect real-world development workflows.

# Personal Portfolio Website
## My Approach
I believe that great websites are the result of **clarity, structure, and iteration**, and by **breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable components**  

My development process focuses on three key principles:
1. **Understand before building** - define goals, users, and structure.  
2. **Break down problems** - turn big challenges into smaller, solvable parts.  
3. **Integrate thoughtfully** - bring each component together into a cohesive system.

## Planned Sections

- **Home / Hero Page** – Simple introduction and navigation to key sections.  
- **About** – My story, learning path, and development philosophy.  
- **Experience** – Projects, learning milestones, and key takeaways.  
- **Projects** – A showcase of my hands-on work and what I’ve built so far.  
- **Contact** – A responsive contact form and social links.  
- **Resume** – Downloadable résumé with my latest experiences and skills.

## Current Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React *(learning)*, TailwindCSS *(learning)*  

**Tools & Workflow:**  
Git, GitHub, VS Code, Figma (for wireframes), Netlify / Vercel (for deployment)


## Development Log

I use this section to document my learning journey, completed tasks, and improvements made to my portfolio website.  
Each log entry represents a milestone in my process of learning, problem-solving, and building with intention.

> I document every key milestone to track growth and identify areas for refinement — turning each iteration into a learning opportunity.
