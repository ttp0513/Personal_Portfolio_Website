# Personal Project - My Own Restaurant Website
## Overview
This repository contains a responsive, front‑end website designed for a restaurant concept. Beyond being a technical project, it represents my childhood dream of owning a restaurant — and my drive to bring that vision to life someday. The site demonstrates my ability to combine design, interactivity, and storytelling into a cohesive digital experience.

## My Approach
I believe that great websites are the result of **clarity, structure, and iteration**, and by **breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable components**  

My development process focuses on three key principles:
1. **Understand before building** - define goals, users, and structure.  
2. **Break down problems** - turn big challenges into smaller, solvable parts.  
3. **Integrate thoughtfully** - bring each component together into a cohesive system.

## Key Highlights
Modern UI/UX: Clean layout, intuitive navigation, and mobile‑friendly responsiveness

Interactive Components: JavaScript‑powered menu toggles, dynamic sections, and smooth animations

Storytelling: Personal brand integration — the restaurant concept reflects my entrepreneurial vision

Scalable Foundation: Built with reusable code and structured for future expansion (reservations, e‑commerce, etc.)

## Sections

- **Home / Hero Page** – Welcoming introduction with restaurant branding, featured dishes, and navigation to key sections.  
- **About** – The story behind the restaurant, its mission, and the inspiration for the cuisine.
