I’m a **Software & Web Developer** who approaches every project with a **system design mindset**. I believes that great products are built by **breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable components** and designing systems that evolve gracefully over time.

Since starting my web development journey in **August 2025**, I’ve been focused on building a strong foundation in **frontend development**, while learning how to plan, structure, and deliver projects that reflect real-world development workflows.

# Personal Project - My Own Restaurant Website
## My Approach
I believe that great websites are the result of **clarity, structure, and iteration**, and by **breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable components**  

My development process focuses on three key principles:
1. **Understand before building** - define goals, users, and structure.  
2. **Break down problems** - turn big challenges into smaller, solvable parts.  
3. **Integrate thoughtfully** - bring each component together into a cohesive system.

## Planned Sections

- **Home / Hero Page** – Welcoming introduction with restaurant branding, featured dishes, and navigation to key sections.  
- **About** – The story behind the restaurant, its mission, and the inspiration for the cuisine.  
- **Menu** – A showcase of food categories (specials, snacks, desserts, drinks) with descriptions and prices.  
- **Order / Cart** – Interactive ordering system where customers can add items, view their cart, and check out.  
- **Contact** – A responsive contact form for inquiries.  
-- **Footer** - Location, hours of operation, phone number,

## Current Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React *(learning)*, TailwindCSS *(learning)*  

**Tools & Workflow:**  
Git, GitHub, VS Code, Figma (for wireframes), Netlify / Vercel (for deployment)
